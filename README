INSTALL
-------
To install this module, just do:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install     (this step may need to be done as the superuser)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
"Image::BMP" objects can parse and even ascii view bitmaps of the .BMP
format.  It can read most of the common forms of this format.

It can be used to get image info, view images, read images and get pixel info.

It does not currently write bmap data, simply because I didn't
have a use for that yet.  Convince me and I might add it.

DEPENDENCIES
------------
This module has no external dependencies.
