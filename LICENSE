     _________________________________________________________________

   Disclaimer:
          These programs aren't packaged in any sort of user-friendly
          format.
          While most of it does something that I consider useful, plenty
          of it is old and written poorly and lacking documentation.
          Lots of the programs here do not fit my definition of [2]TRW.
          If you're looking to write a script like one of these, yea.
          If you don't program, tough noogies for you.
          I recognize that this license is not [3]OpenSource, this is
          quite [4]deliberate

   Why:
          I've made this software freely available for the following
          reasons:

         1. I like to think that I write useful software, so I want other
            people to use it.
         2. I felt like helping out a bit. This is not a common thing for
            me, so enjoy it.
         3. I use [8]free software, and wanted to give something back.
         4. But if you want to help, you can [9]send money
